---

#### The Event:

We are happy to announce that the YCC is joining with other sailing clubs in Port Choiseul to put on "**Les Voiles de Choiseul**", which is a relaxed and friendly regatta-style event where everyone is welcome to join. We hope that as many boats of all different types and sizes (dinghies, catamarans and keelboats) and that as many people including friends, family and children will come and join in the sailing action.
    
Les *Voiles de Choiseul* will take place every Wednesday in September. There will be a briefing at 18h00 in front of the crane at la CNV during which we will explain the plan for the evening and where you will need to fill a form in to participate in the event. The starting sequence will be around 18h45.
    
Each Wednesday a different club will coordinate the running of the event:
- 9 September SPC (Star de Port Choiseul)
- 16 September CNV (Club Nautique de Versoix)
- 23 September DSC (DuPont Sailing Club)
- 30 September YCC (Yachting Club CERN)

#### To Take Part:
Simply book a boat via the YCC reservation table, invite who you would like to join you as crew, then come to the 18h00 briefing on the day itself. Participation is free of charge. Skippers looking for additional crew and crew looking for a boat to join can use our "[Find Skipper or Crew](https://ycc.anselme.info/outing)" platform.
    
As always, Skippers, please record the full names of everyone who crews with you in the Boat Log once you have returned the boat.
